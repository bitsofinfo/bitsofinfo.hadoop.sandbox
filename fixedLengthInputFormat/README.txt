Hadoop FixedLengthInputFormat

This small patch was originally contributed to the Hadoop project in 2009
by bitsofinfo due to the lack of an InputFormat that could read from
fixed length file formats. A patch was contributed for the .20.x version
of Hadoop. In its current state it may need to be upgraded to work with
later versions of hadoop.
